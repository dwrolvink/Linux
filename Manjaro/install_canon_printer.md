Follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5Rm66Li_5Q), but with the changes marked below:

When adding the printer in settings, the tutorial differs for Manjaro I3:
```text
Do mod+z > Settings > Print Settings > Unlock > Add printer
Find Network Printer > [type in host] > Find
In my case (Canon Pixma MG5350S), two printers appear. One with IPS in the name, and one with LPD/LPR in the connection segment
Pick the latter.
Select the driver. The driver for Canon > Pixma > MG5350 should be present. 
After adding, double click the printer for properties, then change the page settings.
```
