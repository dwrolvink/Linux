# Ansible Tutorials
I have a bad memory, and a slight distaste for reading documentation. This tutorial series (in progress) will focus on starting with
something simple and iteratively building up more complexity. For every step, a complete ansible directory will be available.

This series is mainly keeping track of new things that I learn. As I'm already familiar with the basics, 
I'll jump straight to using roles.

# Setup
You'll find piplock files in my ansible directories. This is because I'm using pipenv to isolate my ansible installation. 
If you use pipenv too, you can start a virtual environment in a folder with such files by typing `pipenv shell`. It should
automatically install ansible when starting the virtual environment.

If you don't use pipenv, you can install ansible by running `pip install ansible`. I'm running ansible 2.9.1.
